### Geo Assistant popup resolver — local PHPUnit on Windows agent

**Symptoms:** `composer test` / `vendor/bin/phpunit` fails with `Class "PHPUnit\TextUI\Command" not found` or bash fork errors on some Windows Local Sites shells.

**Tried:** Direct `php vendor/bin/phpunit` — same fatal.

**Likely causes:** Incomplete `vendor/` install or PHP/bash fork instability in Cursor agent shell.

**Do not retry:** Assuming tests passed without running on a machine with working `composer install`.
